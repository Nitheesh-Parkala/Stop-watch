# HTML (index.html)
The HTML file (index.html) is the structure of the web page. It contains:

A container to display the timer.
Start, pause, and reset buttons.
Links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
# CSS (style.css)

The upDateTime function is called in intervals to update the timer display.
The pad function ensures that single-digit numbers are displayed with leading zeros.
